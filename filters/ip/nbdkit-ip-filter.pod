=head1 NAME

nbdkit-ip-filter - filter clients by IP address, process ID, user ID
or group ID

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=ip PLUGIN [allow=addr[,addr...]]
                           [deny=addr[,addr...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-ip-filter> can allow or deny client connections by their IP
address.  Usually it is better to control this outside nbdkit, for
example using TCP wrappers or a firewall, but this filter can be used
if these are not available.

nbdkit E<ge> 1.24 added the ability to filter clients connecting over
local Unix domain sockets by client process ID, user ID and group ID.

=head1 EXAMPLES

 nbdkit --filter=ip [...] allow=127.0.0.1,::1 deny=all

Allow clients to connect on the loopback IPv4 or loopback IPv6
address, deny all other clients.

 nbdkit --filter=ip [...] deny=8.0.0.0/8

Allow any client except connections from the IPv4 C<8.0.0.0/8>
network.

 nbdkit --filter=ip [...] allow=anyipv6 deny=all

Allow IPv6 clients to connect from anywhere, deny all other sources.

 nbdkit -U $tmpdir/sock --filter=ip [...] allow=uid:`id -u` deny=all

Only allow the current user (S<C<id -u>>) to connect over the socket.
It is better to use this as an additional line of defense â€” also
create a temporary directory, make sure it is only accessible by the
user, and place the socket there.

 nbdkit -U sock --filter=ip [...] allow=gid:`id -g` deny=all

Allow anyone in the same group as the current user to connect to the
Unix domain socket.

=head1 RULES

When a client connects, this filter checks its source address against
the allow and deny lists as follows:

=over 4

=item 1

If the address matches any in the allow list, permission is granted.

=item 2

If the address matches any in the deny list, permission is denied.

=item 3

Otherwise permission is granted.

=back

If either the C<allow> or C<deny> parameter is not present then it is
assumed to be an empty list.  The order in which the parameters appear
on the command line does not matter; the allow list is always
processed first and the deny list second.

The C<allow> and C<deny> parameters each contain a comma-separated
list of any of the following:

=over 4

=item B<all>

=item B<any>

These keywords (which both have the same meaning) match any source.

=item B<allipv4>

=item B<anyipv4>

These keywords match any IPv4 address.

=item B<allipv6>

=item B<anyipv6>

These keywords match any IPv6 address.

=item AB<.>BB<.>CB<.>D

This matches the single IPv4 address C<A.B.C.D>, for example
C<127.0.0.1>.

=item AB<.>BB<.>CB<.>DB</>NN

This matches the range of IPv4 addresses C<A.B.C.D/NN>, for example
C<192.168.2.0/24> or C<10.0.0.0/8>.

=item AB<:>BB<:>...

This matches the single IPv6 address C<A:B:...>.  The usual IPv6
address representations can be used (see S<RFC 5952>).

=item AB<:>BB<:>...B</>NN

This matches a range of IPv6 addresses C<A:B:.../NN>.

=item B<pid:>PID

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.24, Linux only)

This matches the process ID C<PID>, if the client connects over a Unix
domain socket.

Note that process IDs are recycled so this alone is not secure enough
to ensure that only a single desired process can connect.  However you
could use it as an additional check.

=item B<uid:>UID

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.24)

This matches the numeric user ID C<UID>, if the client connects over a
Unix domain socket.

=item B<gid:>GID

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.24)

This matches the numeric group ID C<GID>, if the client connects over
a Unix domain socket.

=back

=head2 Not filtered

If neither the C<allow> nor the C<deny> parameter is given the filter
does nothing.

C<AF_VSOCK> connections are always unfiltered.

Unix domain sockets were always unfiltered in S<nbdkit E<le> 1.22>.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<allow=>addr[B<,>...]

Set list of allow rules.  This parameter is optional, if omitted the
allow list is empty.

=item B<deny=>addr[B<,>...]

Set list of deny rules.  This parameter is optional, if omitted the
deny list is empty.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<$filterdir/nbdkit-ip-filter.so>

The filter.

Use C<nbdkit --dump-config> to find the location of C<$filterdir>.

=back

=head1 VERSION

C<nbdkit-ip-filter> first appeared in nbdkit 1.18.
