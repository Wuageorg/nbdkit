=head1 NAME

nbdkit-checkwrite-filter - check writes match contents of plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=checkwrite PLUGIN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-checkwrite-filter> is an nbdkit filter that checks writes to
the underlying plugin match the content of the plugin.  If a client
tries to write non-matching data to the plugin then the filter injects
an EIO Input/output error.  All write-like operations are covered by
this filter, such as trimming and zeroing.

The underlying plugin is opened read-only and is never written to.

=head2 Using this filter to test copying tools

This filter is usually used for testing other NBD tools.

You can check that a copying tool is copying data correctly by
creating an nbdkit instance containing some test data, overlaying this
filter, and copying from and to nbdkit at the same time:

 nbdkit -U - --filter=checkwrite data "@32768 1" \
        --run 'nbdcopy "$uri" "$uri"'

If the copying program is buggy then you will see EIO errors and (if
the copying program also handles errors correctly) it should exit with
an error.

=head2 Other plugins for testing NBD tools

If you are doing this kind of testing you will also want to look at
L<nbdkit-random-plugin(1)> and L<nbdkit-sparse-random-plugin(1)>.
These plugins already have this behaviour built in to them (because it
is more efficient to build it into the plugin) â€” you do B<not> need to
use this filter with those plugins.  This filter is useful for testing
with arbitrary plugins.

=head1 PARAMETERS

There are no parameters specific to this filter.  Parameters are
passed through to the underlying plugin.
