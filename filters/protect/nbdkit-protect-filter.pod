=head1 NAME

nbdkit-protect-filter - write-protect parts of a plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=protect plugin protect=START-END [protect=...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-protect-filter> is a filter for L<nbdkit(1)> that lets you
write-protect parts of the underlying plugin.  This prevents clients
from modifying ranges of the plugin, while still allowing the NBD
connection to be writable in general.

One use for this is to prevent clients from adding a phony header to
the data to make it look like a non-raw disk format (like adding a
qcow2 header), since that can be used in some exploits.

To make the whole plugin readonly, use the nbdkit I<-r> option on the
command line.  To give selective access to the server, use
L<nbdkit-ip-filter(1)>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Protect the boot sector

Protect the first part of the boot sector from writes, but allow the
MBR partition table to be updated:

 nbdkit --filter=protect file disk.img protect=0-0x1bd

=head2 Protect a single partition

Allow clients to access a single partition from a disk, but prevent
access to the partition table, boot sector, other partitions, or any
other metadata outside the partition:

 $ fdisk -l disk.img
 Device    Boot  Start       End  Sectors Size Id Type
 disk.img1 *      2048  12580863 12578816   6G 83 Linux
 $ start=$((2048*512))
 $ end=$((12580864*512-1))
 $ nbdkit --filter=protect file disk.img protect=~$start-$end

=over 4

=item *

This is different from L<nbdkit-partition-filter(1)> since that filter
exposes the partition as a whole device.

=item *

Notice the C<~> character which complements the range protected.  You
might need to escape it from the shell using quotes or backslash.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<protect=>STARTB<->END

Protect the bytes starting at offset C<START> through to offset C<END>
(inclusive).  Writes to the range are only permitted if they do not
change the content.  If an attempt is made to change the content, then
the error C<NBD_EPERM> (Operation not permitted) is returned to the
client.

C<START> and C<END> can be expressed in decimal, octal (starting with
C<0>) or hexadecimal (C<0x>).  If omitted then they default to the
start and end of the underlying plugin respectively.

This parameter can be given multiple times to protect several ranges.

=item B<protect=~>STARTB<->END

This protects the complement of the range C<START> to end C<END>.
