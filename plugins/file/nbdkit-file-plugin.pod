=head1 NAME

nbdkit-file-plugin - nbdkit file plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit file [file=]FILENAME
             [cache=default|none] [fadvise=normal|random|sequential]

 nbdkit file directory=DIRNAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-file-plugin> is a file serving plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.

It serves the named C<FILENAME> over NBD.  Local block devices
(eg. F</dev/sda>) may also be served.  It may also be used to serve
any file within a given C<DIRECTORY>, according to which export name
the guest requests.

=head1 PARAMETERS

One of B<file> or B<directory> must be given to determine which mode
the server will use.

=over 4

=item B<cache=default>

=item B<cache=none>

Using C<cache=none> tries to prevent the kernel from keeping parts of
the file that have already been read or written in the page cache.

=item B<fadvise=normal>

=item B<fadvise=random>

=item B<fadvise=sequential>

This optional flag hints to the kernel that you will access the file
normally, or in a random order, or sequentially.  The exact behaviour
depends on your operating system, but for Linux using C<normal> causes
the kernel to read-ahead, C<sequential> causes the kernel to
read-ahead twice as much as C<normal>, and C<random> turns off
read-ahead.  See also L<posix_fadvise(2)>.

The default is C<normal>.

=item [B<file=>]FILENAME

Serve the file named C<FILENAME>.  A local block device name can also
be used here.  When this mode is used, the export name requested by
the client is ignored.

C<file=> is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.
See L<nbdkit(1)/Magic parameters>.

=item B<directory=>DIRNAME

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.22)

Serve all regular files and block devices located directly within the
directory named C<DIRNAME>, including those found by following
symbolic links.  Other special files in the directory (such as
subdirectories, fifos, or Unix sockets) are ignored.  When this mode
is used, the file to be served is chosen by the export name passed by
the client.  For now, the client must already know what files are
in the directory, although there are plans to expose them via
NBD_OPT_LIST; likewise, a client that requests the default export
(C<"">) will be rejected.  For security, when using directory mode,
this plugin will not accept export names containing slash (C</>).

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Optimizing for random or sequential access

If you know in advance that the NBD client will access the file
randomly or only sequentially then you can hint that to the kernel
using:

 nbdkit file disk.img fadvise=random
 nbdkit file disk.img fadvise=sequential

As described in the L</PARAMETERS> section above, on Linux this
disables or increases the amount of read-ahead that the kernel does.

=head2 Reducing evictions from the page cache

If the file is very large and you know the client will only read/write
the file sequentially one time (eg for making a single copy or backup)
then this will stop other processes from being evicted from the page
cache:

 nbdkit file disk.img fadvise=sequential cache=none

=head2 Files on tmpfs

If you want to expose a file that resides on a file system known to
have poor C<lseek(2)> performance when searching for holes (C<tmpfs>
is known to be one such file system), you can use
L<nbdkit-noextents-filter(1)> to avoid the penalty of probing for
holes.

=head2 Plugin I<--dump-plugin> output

You can obtain extra information about how the file plugin was
compiled by doing:

 nbdkit file --dump-plugin

Some of the fields which may appear are listed below.  Note these are
for information only and may be changed or removed at any time in the
future.

=over 4

=item C<file_blksszget=yes>

=item C<file_blkzeroout=yes>

If both set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of
block devices, where the driver and block device itself supports this.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_punch_hole=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to punch holes (make sparse) files and
block devices.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_zero_range=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of files and
block devices.

=back

=head2 Old C<rdelay> and C<wdelay> parameters.

Before nbdkit supported filters (E<lt> 1.2) this plugin had extra
parameters C<rdelay> and C<wdelay> to insert delays.  These parameters
have been moved to L<nbdkit-delay-filter(1)>.  Modify the command line
to add I<--filter=delay> in order to use these parameters.

=head2 Concatenating files

To concatenate and export multiple files, use
L<nbdkit-split-plugin(1)>.

=head1 DEBUG FLAG

=over 4

=item B<-D file.zero=1>

This enables very verbose debugging of the NBD zero request.  This can
be used to tell if the file plugin is able to zero ranges in the file
or block device efficiently or not.

=item F<$plugindir/nbdkit-file-plugin.so>

Use C<nbdkit --dump-config> to find the location of C<$plugindir>.
