=head1 NAME

nbdkit-S3-plugin - open disk images stored in Amazon S3 or Ceph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit S3 [access-key=...] [secret-key=...] [session-token=...]
           [endpoint-url=...]
           bucket=BUCKET key=FILENAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-S3-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which lets you open
single files stored in Amazon S3 or Ceph as disk images.

Currently it only allows read access, although write access may be
added in future.

This plugin uses the Python Amazon Web Services SDK called Boto3.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 nbdkit S3 endpoint-url=https://ceph.example.com \
           bucket=MY-BUCKET key=disk.img

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<access-key=>ACCESS_KEY

=item B<secret-key=>SECRET_KEY

=item B<session-token=>SESSION_TOKEN

The AWS credentials may be specified on the command line using these
parameters, but it is more secure to pass them using files (see
L</CREDENTIALS> below).

=item B<endpoint-url=>ENDPOINT

If accessing Ceph or another compatible S3 service, provide the
endpoint URL through this parameter.

=item B<bucket=>BUCKET

The bucket containing the file.  This parameter is required.

=item B<key=>FILENAME

The file name within the bucket.  This parameter is required.

=head1 CREDENTIALS

Although AWS credentials can be passed to nbdkit on the command line,
this is not secure since a user on the same machine could read them
using L<ps(1)>.

A better way is to pass the credentials through the
F<~/.aws/credentials> file.  This takes the form:

 [default]
 aws_access_key_id = XXX
 aws_secret_access_key = YYY
 
 [profile]
 aws_access_key_id = XXX
 aws_secret_access_key = YYY

Different profiles from the file can be selected by setting
the C<AWS_PROFILE> environment variable.

There is much more information about credentials in
L<the Boto3 documentation|https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>.

=head1 FILES

=item F<$HOME/.aws/credentials>

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
