nbdkit-streaming-plugin - nbdkit streaming plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit streaming write=FILENAME [size=SIZE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-streaming-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> that can turn
certain kinds of input into a stream.

If the NBD client opens the NBD port, and writes from the start to the
end of the disk without seeking backwards, then this plugin will turn
the resulting disk image into a stream of data which is written to the
named C<write=./pipe> parameter.

               ┌───────────┐
 client        │ nbdkit    │        plugin streams
 writes ──────▶│ streaming │──────▶ data to ./pipe
               │ plugin    │
               └───────────┘

Typical usage is with qemu tools.  The following command does I<not>
work because the output is a pipe or socket:

 $ qemu-img convert input -O raw ./pipe
 qemu-img: ./pipe: error while converting raw: Could not resize file: Invalid argument

However this will work:

 nbdkit -U - streaming write=./pipe \
        --run ' qemu-img convert -n input -O raw $nbd '

              ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐
 reads        │ qemu-img  │       │ nbdkit    │        plugin streams
 input ──────▶│ convert   │──────▶│ streaming │──────▶ data to ./pipe
 file         │ command   │       │ plugin    │
              └───────────┘      ↑└───────────┘
                              Unix domain socket (-U -)

This only works because the output format is raw and qemu-img can
write that linearly (without seeking backwards or writing blocks out
of order).  This approach cannot work for other formats such as qcow2
since those contain metadata that must be updated by seeking back to
the start of the file which is not possible if the output is a pipe.

For use of the I<--run> and I<-U -> options, see L<nbdkit-captive(1)>.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<write=>FILENAME

Write to the named pipe or socket.  If the pipe or socket does not
exist, then it is created (as a named FIFO), otherwise the existing
pipe or socket is opened and used.

This parameter is required.

=item B<pipe=>FILENAME

For backwards compatibility this is a synonym for C<write=FILENAME>.

=item B<size=>SIZE

Specify the virtual size of the stream.

This parameter is optional.  If not specified, then the virtual disk
appears to the client to be very large (effectively infinite).
Whether you need to specify this parameter depends on the client.
Some clients don't check the size and just write/stream, others do
checks or calculations based on the apparent size.
